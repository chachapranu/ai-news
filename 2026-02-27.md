## 💼 Enterprise & Business

### Anthropic CEO Defies Pentagon Demands
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei issued a public statement standing firm against Department of Defense demands to remove safeguards from Claude AI. The Pentagon threatened to designate Anthropic a "supply chain risk" and invoke the Defense Production Act if the company doesn't allow "any lawful use" of its models, specifically for mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.

Amodei stated: "We cannot in good conscience accede to their request." The company argues that while it strongly supports using AI for national defense, current AI systems are not reliable enough for fully autonomous weapons, and mass domestic surveillance is incompatible with democratic values.

**Key Points:**
- Anthropic was the first frontier AI company to deploy models on classified government networks
- The company voluntarily cut off hundreds of millions in revenue by blocking Chinese Communist Party-linked firms
- Pentagon deadline looms with threats of contractor removal or forced compliance

## 💰 Funding & Investment

### OpenAI Raises $110B in Historic Funding Round
OpenAI closed one of the largest private funding rounds in history, raising $110 billion against a $730 billion pre-money valuation. The round includes:

- **$50 billion from Amazon** - Includes expanded AWS partnership with commitment to consume 2GW of AWS Trainium compute
- **$30 billion from Nvidia** - Includes 3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems
- **$30 billion from SoftBank**

The round remains open with additional investors expected to join. Notably, $35 billion of Amazon's investment is contingent on OpenAI either achieving AGI or completing an IPO by year-end.

As part of the Amazon partnership, OpenAI will develop a "stateful runtime environment" for models on Amazon's Bedrock platform and expand the existing AWS partnership by $100 billion.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated: "We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale. Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand."
