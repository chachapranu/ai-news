## 🔐 Security & Threats

### AI-Powered Attack Compromises 600+ FortiGate Firewalls

A Russian-speaking, financially motivated threat actor leveraged commercial AI services to compromise over **600 FortiGate devices across 55 countries** between January 11 and February 18, 2026. This represents a watershed moment in AI-enabled cybercrime.

**Key Details:**
- **AI Tools Used**: The attackers used DeepSeek and Anthropic Claude to generate structured attack plans
- **Attack Method**: Exploited exposed management ports and weak credentials with single-factor authentication (no vulnerability exploitation)
- **Automation**: Claude Code was configured to autonomously execute offensive tools including Impacket scripts, Metasploit modules, and hashcat
- **Geographic Reach**: Concentrated in South Asia, Latin America, Caribbean, West Africa, Northern Europe, and Southeast Asia
- **Significance**: Shows how AI lowers the barrier to entry, enabling even less sophisticated actors to conduct attacks at scale

### Microsoft Copilot and Grok Can Be Abused as Malware C2 Proxies

Check Point Research discovered that AI assistants with web browsing capabilities can be weaponized as covert command-and-control (C2) channels for malware.

**How It Works:**
- Leverages Copilot and Grok's web-browsing/URL-fetch capabilities to retrieve attacker-controlled URLs
- Creates a bidirectional communication channel for malware commands and data exfiltration
- **No authentication required** - works without API keys or registered accounts, making traditional countermeasures ineffective
- AI service domains are treated as routine corporate traffic, evading most conventional detection

**Vendor Response:**
- Microsoft confirmed the research and implemented changes to address the behavior in Copilot's web fetch flow
- As of publication, Grok's URL fetch capabilities remain accessible without authentication

### North Korea Uses Google Gemini for Reconnaissance

Google observed North Korea-linked threat actor **UNC2970** using Gemini AI to conduct reconnaissance and synthesize open-source intelligence (OSINT) to profile high-value targets. Multiple nation-state groups from China and Iran have been documented using AI for various attack phases, including:

- **APT31/Mustang Panda (China)**: Credential harvesting and social engineering
- **APT42 (Iran)**: Vulnerability analysis automation
- **APT41 (China)**: Integrated AI into workflows
- **HONESTCUE malware**: Calls Gemini API to generate code for stage two functionality

## 🚀 Product Launches & Technical Developments

### Ladybird Browser Adopts Rust with AI Assistance

The independent Ladybird web browser project announced on February 23, 2026 that it is adopting Rust with significant help from LLM-based coding assistants.

**Key Achievements:**
- Successfully ported **LibJS** (Ladybird's JavaScript engine) from C++ to Rust in just **2 weeks**
- Resulted in approximately 25,000 lines of Rust code
- Work that would have taken **multiple months** to do manually
- Zero regressions and no performance degradation
- Every AST produced by the Rust parser is identical to the C++ one

**Technical Approach:**
- Andreas Kling used Claude Code and Codex for translation
- Process was human-directed, not autonomous - developer decided what to port, in what order, and what the Rust code should look like through hundreds of small prompts
- Target: LibJS's lexer, parser, AST, and bytecode generator (relatively self-contained with extensive test262 coverage)

**Why Rust:**
- Team searched for memory-safe replacement for C++
- Previously explored Swift but interop and platform support were limited
- Originally rejected Rust in 2024 because "it's not great at C++ style OOP"
- Made the "pragmatic choice" after another year

## 📈 Key Takeaways

1. **Security Paradigm Shift**: AI is fundamentally changing the threat landscape, enabling less sophisticated actors to conduct large-scale attacks. The FortiGate campaign demonstrates that AI can compress months of work into weeks.

2. **AI as Attack Infrastructure**: Legitimate AI services (Copilot, Grok, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini) are being weaponized for both offensive operations and as covert communication channels. The industry must address these dual-use concerns.

3. **Global AI Race Intensifies**: India's positioning as an AI hub with $200B+ in commitments signals a shift in the global AI power structure. The Global South is becoming a major player in AI development and deployment.

4. **AI-Assisted Development is Real**: Ladybird's 2-week Rust migration (vs. months manually) proves that AI coding assistants are production-ready for large-scale refactoring projects when properly human-directed.

5. **User Control Matters**: Firefox's AI kill switch reflects growing demand for user autonomy over AI features. Mozilla's promise not to re-enable features addresses trust concerns.

6. **Enterprise Adoption Accelerating**: Major partnerships between AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and enterprise players (TCS, Infosys, Accenture, BCG, McKinsey) signal that 2026 is the year AI moves from experimentation to production deployment.

7. **Defense Fundamentals Still Critical**: Despite AI's sophistication, strong defensive basics (patch management, credential hygiene, network segmentation) remain the most effective countermeasures.

8. **Security Industry Disruption**: Traditional cybersecurity companies face existential challenges from AI-powered vulnerability scanning tools, as evidenced by major stock drops following Anthropic's announcement.

9. **The OpenAI Alumni Effect**: Former OpenAI employees are reshaping the competitive landscape, with 18 startups attracting significant investor interest and creating genuine alternatives to their former employer.
