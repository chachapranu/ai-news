## 🔐 Security & Threats

### AI-Assisted Threat Actor Compromises 600+ FortiGate Devices
A Russian-speaking threat actor leveraged commercial AI tools (DeepSeek, Anthropic Claude) to compromise over 600 FortiGate devices across 55 countries between January 11 and February 18, 2026. The attacker exploited exposed management ports and weak credentials rather than vulnerabilities, demonstrating how AI lowers barriers to entry for less-skilled threat actors conducting sophisticated operations at scale. The attacker used AI for reconnaissance, attack planning, command generation, and even DCSync attacks against Active Directory.

### AI Chatbots Weaponized as Malware Command Centers
Researchers discovered that Microsoft Copilot and xAI Grok can be transformed into covert malware command-and-control (C2) channels through their web-browsing capabilities. The technique requires no API keys or accounts, making traditional defenses like account suspension ineffective. Attackers can also use these AI services as "external decision engines" to devise evasion strategies and determine next actions based on victim system details.

### State-Backed Hackers Using Gemini AI for Reconnaissance
Google's Threat Intelligence Group reported that North Korean-linked group UNC2970 leveraged Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets for campaign planning and reconnaissance. Other threat groups including APT31/Mustang Panda (China), APT42 (Iran), and APT41 (China) have integrated the tool into their workflows for credential harvesting, social engineering, and vulnerability analysis automation. Researchers also identified HONESTCUE malware that calls the Gemini API to generate code for stage two functionality.

### Anthropic Launches Claude Code Security (Feb 21)
Anthropic rolled out Claude Code Security in limited research preview to Enterprise and Team customers. The tool scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted patches, catching complex flaws in business logic and access control that traditional static analysis tools miss. Using Claude Opus 4.6, Anthropic's team found over 500 vulnerabilities in production open-source codebases—bugs that had gone undetected for decades. The tool maintains a human-in-the-loop approach where nothing is applied without developer approval.

## 📈 Key Takeaways

1. **AI as a Double-Edged Sword**: While defensive tools like Claude Code Security are emerging, threat actors are simultaneously leveraging commercial AI services (DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Grok) for reconnaissance, attack planning, and even as C2 infrastructure.

2. **Enterprise AI Adoption Accelerates**: OpenAI's partnership with major consulting firms (Accenture, BCG, Capgemini, McKinsey) signals a maturation of enterprise AI deployment, with early adopters seeing dramatic productivity gains (6 weeks → 1 day for production optimization).

3. **India Emerges as AI Hub**: Massive infrastructure investments ($100B+ from Adani), government funding ($1.1B VC fund), and international partnerships (Pax Silica, G42/Cerebras) position India as a major AI powerhouse.

4. **Security Industry Disruption**: Traditional cybersecurity companies face existential challenges from AI-powered vulnerability scanning tools, as evidenced by major stock drops (8%+ declines) following Anthropic's announcement.

5. **The OpenAI Alumni Effect**: Former OpenAI employees are reshaping the competitive landscape, with 18 startups attracting significant investor interest and creating genuine alternatives to their former employer.

6. **Vulnerability Discovery Gap**: AI enables both attackers and defenders to find flaws faster, but the 32% day-zero exploitation rate and 1,265% increase in phishing suggests attackers currently have the advantage.

7. **From Hype to Practice**: Industry shift toward practical agentic workflows enabled by MCP protocol, moving from demos to day-to-day production use cases.
