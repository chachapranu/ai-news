## 🔐 Security & Threats

### AI-Powered Cyberattacks Reach Unprecedented Scale

**Russian Threat Actor Compromises 600+ FortiGate Devices Using AI**

A financially motivated, Russian-speaking threat actor has successfully compromised over 600 FortiGate devices across 55 countries between January 11 and February 18, 2026. The attacker leveraged commercial generative AI services—specifically DeepSeek and Anthropic Claude—to bridge skill gaps and execute an enterprise-scale attack.

**Key Details:**
- AI services were used to generate attack plans, conduct vulnerability assessments, and create custom tooling
- The campaign exploited exposed management ports (443, 8443, 10443, and 4443) and weak single-factor authentication credentials
- Post-compromise activities included extracting device configurations, compromising Active Directory environments, and targeting Veeam backup servers
- This demonstrates how AI democratizes cybercrime, enabling less sophisticated operators to conduct attacks that previously required larger, more skilled teams

### North Korean Hackers Weaponize Google's Gemini AI

Google's threat intelligence team has observed the North Korea-linked group **UNC2970** using Gemini AI to enhance cyberattack operations. The group is leveraging the AI model for:

- **Reconnaissance and target profiling**: Synthesizing OSINT data and profiling high-value targets in cybersecurity, defense, and aerospace sectors
- **Social engineering support**: Compiling detailed dossiers on potential victims to craft tailored phishing personas
- **Operation Dream Job campaign**: Supporting their ongoing campaign that impersonates corporate recruiters to target aerospace, defense, and energy sector employees

This case demonstrates how state-sponsored actors are systematically integrating AI into every phase of their attack lifecycle, from planning to execution.

### AI Assistants Exploited as Malware C2 Proxies

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed that AI assistants with web browsing or URL fetching capabilities can be turned into stealthy command-and-control (C2) relays. The vulnerability has been demonstrated against:

- **Microsoft Copilot**
- **xAI Grok**

This creates a new attack vector where legitimate AI tools can be abused to mask malicious communications, making detection significantly more challenging for security teams.

### OpenClaw AI Agent Security Concerns

Infostealer malware has successfully stolen OpenClaw AI agent configuration files, including authentication tokens and API keys. Security researchers warn that exposed instances and malicious skills are expanding the attack surface for AI-powered development tools.

**Supply Chain Attack Alert:**
On February 17, 2026, at 3:26 AM PT, an unauthorized party used a compromised npm publish token to publish a malicious update to Cline CLI on the NPM registry (cline@2.3.0), which stealthily installed OpenClaw.

**Timeline Note:** On February 15, 2026, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that OpenClaw's founder, Peter Steinberger, would be joining OpenAI.

## 💼 Enterprise & Business

### Anthropic Defies Pentagon's AI Demands

In a high-stakes confrontation, Anthropic is refusing to comply with Pentagon demands to modify its AI safety protocols. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given the company until Friday, February 28, 2026, to either:

1. Give the U.S. military unrestricted access to its AI model, or
2. Face consequences including being declared a "supply chain risk" or invoke the Defense Production Act to force compliance

**Anthropic's Position:**
The company has long maintained that it doesn't want its technology used for:
- Mass surveillance of Americans
- Fully autonomous weapons systems

This standoff raises critical questions about government influence over AI companies, vendor dependency in defense contracting, and the balance between national security and AI safety principles.
